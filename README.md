# rust-bagchaal
Bagchaal in rust. Tried using software design pattern

Here was my target when starting this project.
1. In rust.
2. use design patterns commonly seen

Which have both been met.
I have some plans for this. But i doubt i will continue this. If i do, it will be using termion if i use tui.
Or i may just do it in gtk or other toolkit. or a 3d version in opengl and godot. lets see what we can do.
